### Usage

### FAQ

- **How can I change what movies are displayed?**

  - There are many ways, but the easiest would be to edit entertainment_center.py and add, update, or remove any movies you wish.

- **What data does each movie instance keep track of?**

  - Title, storyline, poster, and YouTube trailer URL. The Movie class can be found in media.py if you want to learn more.
